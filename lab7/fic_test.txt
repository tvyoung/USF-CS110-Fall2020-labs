They're somewhere in the woods of northern England when Mina jerks awake in the middle of the night, limbs trapped in the tangle of the sheets, eyes wild and afraid.
The buzz of cicadas wafts in from outside, muted and constant.
It should be a comforting sound, but Mina can't breathe at all.
She's pulled her arms free by the time Nayeon stirs beside her, fingernails raking harsh lines down her throat in an effort to claw out the phantom smoke in her lungs, still half-lost in a dream.
She must make some sort of noise, because Nayeon is up in an instant, out of her mattress and onto Mina's: knees on the edge, leaning over her.
"Hey," she says, "hey, you're okay."
Catches Mina's hands and wraps them in her own, waiting for the violent shudder that runs down the length of her spine to settle.
"Nayeon," Mina gasps, the moment she has enough air to get it out. "Nayeonâ€”"
Nayeon hushes her, squeezing her hands a little tighter, murmuring low reassurances into her ear.
Her breath is hot and fluttery and breaks unevenly on Mina's skin; under the lamplight, Mina can see the shine of her eyes.
Nayeon looks like she might cry.
"It's me," she says. "Just me."
Finally, when Mina's heart has stopped thundering so painfully in her chest, when the terror has abated and given way to dull exhaustion, Nayeon relaxes her grip to card her fingers carefully through Mina's hair.
Slips into the bed behind her, arms around her waist and under her sleepshirt, pressing cool palms to the flat of her stomach. 
For the first time in a long while, Mina surrenders to quiet, dreamless sleep.
